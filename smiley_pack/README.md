By default, smiley_pack will use smiley code based on the English language.  However, we have a couple of translations now.  In the "lang" folder, you will find French (fr) and spanish (es) translations.  Simply copy the directories to addon/ (so smiley_pack_xx ends up in the same place as smiley_pack) then enable each language you require in your admin panel.

The English version is **required** for the other languages to work.  This is to a) save space by keeping all the smileys in one place, and b) for compatibility with other servers who will overwhelmingly be using the English version.
